## 3. Where do I change…?

| I want to… | Edit |
|---|---|
| Prices, plans, reports per plan, statements per report | `packages/shared/src/pricing.ts` (and `apps/web/offline/app_offline.js` → `PLANS` for the offline tool) |
| Turn payments on | `.env`: `PAYMENTS_MODE=razorpay` + `RAZORPAY_*` (`docs/PAYMENTS_RAZORPAY.md`) |

## 4. Main flows (one line each)

| Flow | Path through the code |
|---|---|
| Analyse statements | workspace → `POST /api/v1/analyses` (consent, sniff, encrypt, Garage, queue) → worker (`pipeline.ts` → `engine-child.ts`) → one-transaction store → `GET /analyses/:id` → `POST /reports` (`create_report_from_analysis()`) |
| Add / remove a statement | "+" → upload with `reportId` → `POST /reports/:id/files` (file-set lock) · × → `POST /reports/:id/files/remove` |
| View a report | `/report/[id]` → `GET /api/v1/reports/:id` → `lib/report-ui/render.js` |
| Sign in | `/login` → `/api/v1/auth/otp/*` or `/api/v1/auth/google/*` → `lens_session` cookie (`packages/shared/src/auth/session.ts`) |

| Nightly clean-up | worker schedule 02:00 IST → `purge_raw_files`, `purge_drafts`, `purge_otp_codes`, `purge_logs`; storage sweep every 15 minutes |
| Deploy | tag `v*` → `deploy.yml` → GHCR → `infra/scripts/deploy.sh` (migrate, start, ready check, rollback) |

| `apps/web/components/admin/UserAdmin.tsx` | Admin "User management" tab: search and filter users, see whose reports are in the research dataset, Request reports (owner), Restrict / Unrestrict (owner, admin), Delete (owner). |
| `apps/web/components/ErrorReporter.tsx` | Sends browser errors to /api/v1/errors (max 5 per page load). |
| `packages/shared/src/admin/queries.ts` | SQL behind each admin tab (DAU/MAU, revenue, errors, tickets, product). |
| `packages/shared/src/admin/rbac.ts` | Roles and permissions (owner, admin, support, finance, analyst): the rules only. The guards live in apps/web and apps/api. |
| `packages/shared/src/admin/telemetry.ts` | Product events and error capture over an injected connection (best-effort; never breaks a request). |

### API

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `apps/api/src/app.ts` | Builds the Fastify app (/api/v1): cookies, multipart limits, rate limits, CSRF origin check, zod validation, OpenAPI, every route. |
| `apps/api/src/config.ts` | API configuration from env, checked once at startup (fails fast on missing secrets). |
| `apps/api/src/lib/http.ts` | Response helpers with the same JSON shapes as the old Next routes ({ error, message }), session lookup, request adapters. |
| `apps/api/src/lib/markdown.ts` | REQ-7 blog: Markdown → safe HTML on the server (no raw HTML, no scripts/iframes, safe links), reading time and slugs. |
| `apps/api/src/lib/queue.ts` | Enqueues analysis jobs on BullMQ (Redis) for apps/worker; job id = analysis id, so a repeat is a no-op. |
| `apps/api/src/lib/sniff.ts` | Upload type check: the real file type from its bytes (the engine's own detectKind) plus a reject list for non-statements. |
| `apps/api/src/lib/storage.ts` | Object storage (S3 API on Garage): encrypted statements (api key write-only), export archives (read-only), blog media (read/write, public via the API). |
| `apps/api/src/main.ts` | API process entry: config, Postgres (lens_app only), Redis, storage, queue, check-up reminder, weekly summary and market data timers; listens on PORT; graceful shutdown. |
| `apps/api/src/routes/blog.ts` | REQ-7 blog API: public posts/feed/media (cacheable) and owner/admin-only writing, publishing, live preview and image upload (WebP via sharp). |
| `apps/api/src/routes/health.ts` | GET /health (liveness) and GET /ready (Postgres as lens_app, Redis, storage). |

### Worker

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `apps/worker/src/benchmarks.ts` | Peer benchmarks, built nightly (02:45 IST) from the research views (consenting traders only): each trader's latest report per segment, the metrics from packages/shared/src/insights/benchmarks.ts, and only quantiles of groups with 50+ traders. |
| `apps/worker/src/config.ts` | Worker configuration from env: lens_worker DB URL, Redis, storage (read + delete), file keys, engine limits. |
| `apps/worker/src/engine-child.ts` | Child process that runs the engine on one job's decrypted files (memory-capped, killed on timeout); returns the report, per-file fingerprints, fills and parse info. |
| `apps/worker/src/engine-runner.ts` | Starts engine-child.js per job with a memory cap and a timeout; a hung or crashing parse fails that file, not the worker (plan D10). |
| `apps/worker/src/engine-version.ts` | engine_version written on every derived row: a hash of the engine's source files and package.json (fixed at build time in the image). |
| `apps/worker/src/export.ts` | "Export my data": builds the user's archive (all data as JSON + original statements still stored), encrypts it, stores it for 7 days; expiry sweep. |
| `apps/worker/src/main.ts` | Worker process: BullMQ consumer for analysis jobs (retries, dead-letter on final failure), data exports and research datasets, schedules (nightly purge, storage sweep, research dataset on the 1st and 16th, peer benchmarks nightly), local health endpoint. |
| `apps/worker/src/maintenance.ts` | Scheduled jobs: nightly purge (raw files after 30 days, unsaved drafts after 24 h, old sign-in codes) and the storage sweep that deletes shredded objects. |
| `apps/worker/src/pipeline.ts` | One analysis job: fetch + decrypt files (logged) → engine in a child process → store payload, trades, fills, metrics, traits, parse runs in one transaction. |
| `apps/worker/src/queue-worker.ts` | BullMQ consumer for analysis jobs: runs the pipeline, retries infrastructure errors, and on the final failure marks the analysis failed (dead letter). |
| `apps/worker/src/research.ts` | Research dataset (every 1st and 16th, or "Build now"): CSVs from the pseudonymised research views (opted-in users only), zipped, encrypted, kept 90 days; report links kept for the owner's lookup; expiry sweep. |
| `apps/worker/src/storage.ts` | Object storage for the worker (S3 API on Garage): read encrypted files, delete shredded ones. In-memory version for tests. |
| `apps/worker/src/zip.ts` | Minimal ZIP writer (deflate, CRC-32 from node:zlib) for the data-export archive; no third-party dependency. |

### Core

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `apps/web/lib/api-browser.ts` | Browser-side calls to the API (/api/v1 on the same site): JSON helper and multipart upload; errors keep the API's { error, message }. |
| `apps/web/lib/api-client.ts` | How the website talks to the API: server components call it over the private network with the visitor's cookie; the browser calls /api/v1 on the same site. |
| `apps/web/lib/auth/country.ts` | Visitor country for server components (Cloudflare CF-IPCountry / CloudFront / X-Country). |
| `packages/shared/src/auth/request.ts` | Client IP and country for API routes. |
| `packages/shared/src/consent-text.ts` | The exact consent sentences shown to users and their policy version (no Node imports, so the website can use them too). |
| `packages/shared/src/consent.ts` | Consent wording and version (from consent-text.ts) plus the SHA-256 of the exact text, stored with each consent row. |
| `packages/shared/src/db.ts` | Minimal query interface (pg.Pool / pg.Client satisfy it) so shared SQL helpers work with the web pool and the API pool. |
| `packages/shared/src/file-crypto.ts` | Envelope encryption for raw statement files: AES-256-GCM with a random key per file, wrapped by a KEK from env (rule 7). |
| `packages/shared/src/jobs.ts` | Queue names and job payloads shared by apps/api (producer) and apps/worker (consumer). |
| `packages/shared/src/limits.ts` | App-wide limits (max files, file types, report lifetime). |
| `packages/shared/src/mail.ts` | Email sender (SMTP / Google Workspace, Resend, Amazon SES, or a local log file) and the email templates (sign-in code, research invite). |

### Styles

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `apps/web/app/blog.css` | REQ-7 blog: list, cards (also the landing preview), article typography, CTA card, editor preview. Uses the design tokens in globals.css. |
| `apps/web/app/globals.css` | Base app styles: colours, header, panels, buttons, forms, print rules. |
| `apps/web/app/landing.css` | Landing page styles: one system of centred titles, equal cards, sample dashboard, plans. |
| `apps/web/app/motion.css` | Motion system (19 Oct 2026): easing/duration tokens, a CSS spring, page and view transitions, entrances, reveal-on-scroll, press/lift, sliding tab ink, shimmer, sheets. Reduced motion turns it all off. |
| `apps/web/app/report.css` | Report, Progress tab, analysing loader and admin console styles (shared by website and offline tool). |
| `apps/web/app/template.tsx` | Route transition: every navigation fades in and rises 10px (motion.css .mo-page); static with reduced motion. |
| `apps/web/app/workspace.css` | Workspace styles (file tabs, All files, +, plan card, MON-YY history with rename, lock message), ported from the offline tool. |
| `apps/web/components/motion/Loading.tsx` | Loading placeholder: a shimmering skeleton for sighted users; screen readers still hear "Loading…". |
| `apps/web/components/motion/MotionRuntime.tsx` | One small runtime for the motion system: reveal-on-scroll ([data-reveal] → .in), stagger indexes, sliding tab ink under every .tabs bar, count-ups ([data-count-up]), header glass on scroll, smooth in-page anchors. |
| `apps/web/lib/motion/viewTransition.ts` | withViewTransition(): runs a DOM/React update inside document.startViewTransition when available (cross-fade + slide, motion.css), otherwise directly. Never with reduced motion. |

| `packages/db/migrations/0022_user_admin.sql` | Admin user management: restrict / unrestrict (owner, admin) and delete (owner) as role-checked, audited functions; research consent invites sent by email. |
| `packages/db/migrations/0023_credits_spec.sql` | Credits spec (19 Oct 2026): "+" refused once the report's plan window has ended; user_reports_left() = usable reports (active plans only). |

| `packages/db/migrations/0025_research_links.sql` | Research datasets stay pseudonymised for download, but PnL Lens keeps the link: research_export_reports (report pseudonym → report) and an owner-only, audited research_lookup(). |
| `packages/db/migrations/0026_plan_snapshots.sql` | The 30-day plan as it was given to the user (rules, metrics, targets), kept so the next report can score it (check-up: Met / Missed per rule). |
| `packages/db/migrations/0027_trade_journal.sql` | Trade journal: the user's own setup, tags, emotion and note per trade (keyed by the trade's identity, so a note follows the trade into every report); private (never in research); in "Export my data"; removed with the account. |
| `packages/db/migrations/0028_report_capital.sql` | Optional "capital used" per report (analysis roadmap B1): the user's own figure, in the report's currency, so results can be shown as % returns and % risk. Never required. |
| `packages/db/migrations/0029_weekly_digest.sql` | Weekly summary email (analysis roadmap B5): an opt-in flag per user (off by default) and one row per user and week, claimed before sending so the email goes out at most once a week. |

| `packages/db/migrations/0031_market_daily.sql` | Market context (India only): daily closes of NIFTY 50, NIFTY BANK and India VIX, fetched automatically by the api (Upstox public history, NSE as fallback), and a sync status row per symbol for monitoring. |
| `packages/db/migrations/0032_founding_traders.sql` | Founding traders (share card v2): users.founding_no 1–1000, given once on a user's first paid plan (or a manual grant the owner marks as founding), never to staff or test accounts; users.is_test; a gap-free counter. |
| `packages/db/optional/pg_cron.sql` | Optional: schedule the purge inside Postgres if pg_cron is available. |
| `packages/db/scripts/seed-dev.mjs` | Applies seed.sql (dev user with credits) — only when SEED_DEV_DATA=true (set by infra/compose.dev.yml only). |
| `packages/db/scripts/setup-roles.mjs` | Creates/updates the login roles lens_app and lens_worker with passwords from env (runs after migrations, as superuser). |

| `packages/db/src/queries/privacy.ts` | Consent history, data export/delete requests, account deletion, and the scheduled purge/sweep jobs (worker). |
| `packages/db/src/queries/reports.ts` | Reports (api, lens_app): claim an analysis, add files (file-set lock), rename, delete, MON-YY history, Progress history, trades. |
| `packages/db/src/queries/users-admin.ts` | Admin user management: restrict / unrestrict and delete through the role-checked database functions (0022). |
| `packages/db/src/types.ts` | Kysely table types for the schema after migration 0019 (hand-written; every table is exercised through these types by test/db/*). |

### Ops

| File | What it does |
|---|---|

| `apps/api/test/benchmarks.test.ts` | How you compare: the report's segment, "not enough traders yet" without quantiles, the share it beats from stored quantiles (own segment first, else all traders, lower-is-better flipped), owner only. |
| `apps/api/test/blog.test.ts` | REQ-7 blog API: roles (403 for support/finance/analyst/user), CRUD, publish visibility, Markdown sanitising, slug redirects, image upload checks (WebP + 1200×630), cache headers, sign-up/upload attribution. |
| `apps/api/test/digest.test.ts` | Weekly summary: prefs on/off, unsubscribe link (good and bad token), sender: only opted-in active users with a report, from Monday 09:00 IST, once a week, with focus rules, report link and a working unsubscribe link. |

| `apps/api/test/journal.test.ts` | Journal API: save, list, update, empty removes, delete; validation (emotion, tags, sizes); private to each user; signed-out 401. |
| `apps/api/test/market.test.ts` | Market data: automatic sync (Upstox, only the missing days, retries, NSE fallback, status and stale flag when both fail) with a fake network; the report route (India only, masked for other markets, owner only). |
| `apps/api/test/openapi-doc.ts` | Builds the app with placeholder dependencies (no database connection is opened) to read its OpenAPI document. |
| `apps/api/test/openapi.test.ts` | apps/api/openapi.json matches the routes (regenerate: npm run openapi -w @pnl-lens/api); global and sign-in rate limits. |
| `apps/api/test/password.test.ts` | Email + password sign-in: start → code for new emails, required password after the first code, password login, lockout, forgot, change needs a fresh sign-in, other devices signed out, no hash leaks. |
| `apps/api/test/payments-admin.test.ts` | Payments (off mode, Checkout verify, webhook signature, replay idempotency, legacy path) and admin RBAC (tabs, roles, audit, owner-only grant). |
| `apps/api/test/plan.test.ts` | 30-day plan: owner-only PDF (2 pages, links, audited, no-store), plan snapshot + check-up on the next report, public .ics, reminders (set/replace/cancel/validate), sender claims before sending and sends once. |
| `apps/api/test/research.test.ts` | Research dataset routes: owner only (403 for admin, support, finance, analyst, user), Build now (one at a time), download decrypts and is audited, expired → 404. |
| `apps/api/test/sniff.test.ts` | Upload type check: every engine fixture is accepted with the engine's kind; executables, images, wrong ZIPs and binaries posing as CSV are refused. |

| `apps/worker/test/benchmarks.test.ts` | Peer benchmarks build: only consenting traders, each once per segment (latest report), quantiles only for groups of 50+, the table replaced atomically, no ids stored; grants. |
| `apps/worker/test/export.test.ts` | "Export my data" on a real database: complete archive (JSON + original statements), encrypted at rest, access logged, expires after 7 days. |
| `apps/worker/test/global-setup.ts` | Builds the worker bundles once before the tests (the engine child process runs from dist/, as in the image). |
| `apps/worker/test/helpers.ts` | Worker test helpers: encrypted uploads of real fixtures (as the API stores them), pipeline deps with the real engine child, golden cases. |
| `apps/worker/test/hostile.test.ts` | Hostile files: a parse that runs too long is killed, one that exhausts memory crashes only its child; the worker carries on and the job fails cleanly. |
| `apps/worker/test/pipeline.test.ts` | Every golden case through the real pipeline (encrypted storage → engine child → DB): stored report equals the parity output; failures cost no credit. |
| `apps/worker/test/queue.test.ts` | Real sample files through the real queue (API producer → Redis → worker consumer); retries then dead letter; nightly purge and storage sweep. |
| `apps/worker/test/research.test.ts` | Research dataset: only opted-in users, encrypted at rest, 4 CSVs + README, no emails/names/file names/internal ids, per-export report pseudonyms, links kept for the owner's audited lookup, consent withdrawal, expiry sweep, worker role limits. |
| `packages/db/test/db/blog.test.ts` | REQ-7 blog in the database: app role reads the public view only, owner/admin-only functions, audit rows, visibility rules, slug redirects. |
| `packages/db/test/db/capital.test.ts` | Report capital (0028): set and clear by the owner only, limits enforced, app may update only that column (and title), included in "Export my data". |
| `packages/db/test/db/credits.test.ts` | Credits spec (19 Oct 2026) acceptance checks in the database: reports left, "+" free up to the limit, failed files and deletes spend/return nothing, plan window, soonest-expiring first. |
| `packages/db/test/db/digest.test.ts` | Weekly summary (0029): opt-in off by default, the app may switch it, one send per user and week, closing the account turns it off and clears the sends. |
| `packages/db/test/db/founding.test.ts` | Founding trader numbers (0032): given once and in order, on a paid plan or a manual grant marked founding, never to staff or test accounts, never past 1000, no gaps after a rolled-back grant; reset only before the first paid order; app roles cannot touch the counter. |
| `packages/db/test/db/harness.ts` | DB test harness: fresh database per suite on the throwaway test Postgres, real migrate + setup-roles scripts, role-scoped clients, fixtures. |
| `packages/db/test/db/journal.test.ts` | Trade journal (0027): save, update, empty = removed, one per trade, app grants (no access for the worker or research), included in "Export my data" with the 30-day plans and reminders, removed when the account is closed. |
| `packages/db/test/db/migrations.test.ts` | Migrations apply from 0001 on an empty database and on top of a 0007 database with old data; the old web flow keeps working. |

| `packages/db/test/db/plan-snapshots.test.ts` | Plan snapshots (0026): app may save and read but not change; one per report and day; the check-up picks the newest plan made before a report; closing the account removes plans and reminders. |
| `packages/db/test/db/plans.test.ts` | Server-side plan rules: create_report_from_analysis (all refusal reasons, races), file-set lock, owner-only manual grant, webhook replay. |
| `packages/db/test/db/privacy.test.ts` | Rule 7 in the database: consents, 30-day file purge with key shredding, draft purge, report delete, account delete, research views. |
| `packages/db/test/db/research-links.test.ts` | Research links (0025): worker may insert but not read report links; research_lookup is owner-only, needs a reason, needs the dataset for report codes, audits every lookup, shows deleted accounts as deleted. |
| `packages/db/test/db/rewrap.test.ts` | Key rotation: rewrap-keys.mjs moves every file key from k1 to k2; files still decrypt; dry run changes nothing; re-running is safe. |
| `packages/db/test/db/roles.test.ts` | Least privilege (rule 4): what lens_app, lens_worker, lens_research and PUBLIC can and cannot do after migration 0014. |
| `packages/db/test/db/store.test.ts` | Worker store step on a real database: every golden report stored as payload + trades + metrics + traits in one transaction, idempotent. |
| `packages/db/test/db/user-admin.test.ts` | User management functions (0022): who may restrict or delete whom, sessions end on restrict, delete anonymises, audit rows; research_invites grants. |
| `packages/db/test/normalise.test.ts` | Engine output -> table rows, for every golden report (no database needed); file fingerprint matches the offline tool. |
| `packages/db/tests/01_functions.sql` | SQL tests for the database functions and the app role restrictions. |
| `packages/engine/test/behaviour.test.ts` | 100-trait library: uniqueness, wording, variety. |

| `packages/engine/test/extract.test.ts` | PDF, DOCX and legacy DOC reading matches the CSV originals. |

| `tests/e2e-web/market.spec.ts` | Market context (India only): an Indian report shows NIFTY over the period and results by VIX level and index move; a non-Indian (crypto) report shows no market section at all. |
