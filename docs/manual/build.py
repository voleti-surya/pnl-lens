<h3>How reports are counted</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>A report</b> is one analysis. Creating it uses one report from your plan. The pill at the top of the site shows how many you have left (“4 reports left”).</li>
<li><b>A statement</b> is one file from your broker. A report can combine 2 (Single) or 3 (other plans) statements, for example your equity and F&amp;O files, or two brokers. Adding a statement to an existing report with <b>+</b> is free while your plan is valid.</li>
<li><b>Plans add up.</b> If you hold Single and Snapshot together, you have 1 + 5 = 6 reports.</li>
<li><b>Reports are kept until you delete them.</b> When a plan ends you can still open every report you made; you just can't create new ones until you choose a plan again.</li>
<li>Deleting a report does not give the report back to your plan. Removing a statement from a report does not free its place either.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Try it before you pay</h3>
<p>Without a plan you can still upload a statement and see a <b>free preview</b>: your net P&amp;L, total charges, number of trades and two insights, with the rest of the report blurred. Nothing is saved and nothing is charged. Choose a plan to see the full report.</p>
<h3>Your trading journey</h3>
<p>The bar at the top of the dashboard shows five steps: <b>First report → Baseline score → Month-2 check-up → 3-month trend → 12-month discipline</b>. It ticks off what you have done, shows which plan unlocks the next step, and suggests your next action (for example “Upload next month's statement”). You can hide it.</p>''')

<p>The statistics behind your results. Every figure comes from your own trades.</p>
<h3>Skill or luck?</h3>
<p>PnL Lens reshuffles your trades thousands of times to see how sure it can be that your average trade is really positive.</p>
<ul><li><b>Verdict</b>: <i>Your edge looks real</i>, <i>Not proven yet</i>, <i>Negative edge</i>, or <i>Too few trades</i> (under 20).</li>
<li><b>Average trade</b> with a 90% range (“90% sure it is between {c}354 and {c}4,177”) and a bar showing that range against zero.</li>
<li><b>Chance it is luck</b>: the share of reshuffles where the average trade is zero or worse.</li>
<li><b>Trades to be sure</b>: how many more trades it would take to know, or “enough already”.</li></ul>
<h3>Your next 100 trades</h3>
<p>If your next 100 trades look like your past ones, in random order: a fan chart of likely results (middle outcome, half of outcomes, 9 in 10 outcomes), the middle and 1-in-20 outcome, the chance of ending in profit, the typical and 1-in-20 worst dip, and the chance of giving back a quarter or half of your profit. It is a picture of your past results, not a forecast.</p>
<h3>How you compare</h3>
<p>Where you stand among traders like you (same market and main instrument, for example “{'India · Index options' if india else 'US · Stocks'}”): trades won, average win ÷ average loss, profit factor, average trade as % of position, and trades that lost more than 10%. Each shows “Better than 72% of 312 traders”. Comparisons use only traders who chose to share their data, never names, and a group is shown only once it has at least 50 traders; until then the panel says how many there are so far. Updated nightly.</p>
{market}
<h3>Your results as % of capital</h3>
<p>Optional. Add the capital you traded with in this report (for example {r['ex_cap']}) and PnL Lens shows your return (and a year at this pace for statements of 30 days or more, not compounded), your average trade and loss, your largest single loss, your worst day and worst drawdown as % of that capital, and how many trades lost more than 1% or 2% of it. Change or remove it anytime; only you see it.</p>
<h3>Consistency and risk</h3>
<p>By trading day: % of green days and the average day, your best and worst day (and how the worst compares with a normal losing day), the worst drawdown with how many days it lasted and how long it took to make back, a Sharpe-style and a Sortino-style ratio (return per unit of risk; above 1 is steady), how much of your profit came from your 3 best days, % of green months, and days since your last high.</p>
<h3>Wins and losses in R</h3>
<p>Each trade measured in “R”, where 1R is your average loss: how many trades lost 2R or more, how many won 3R or more, and your average trade in R. Good trading usually means many small losses near 1R and some wins of 2R and more.</p>
<h3>Options by days to expiry</h3>
<p>Your option trades grouped by days from entry to expiry: expiry day, 1–2 days, 3–7 days and 8+ days.</p>
<h3>When you trade</h3>
<p>A heatmap of entry weekday by hour: the number is how many trades, the colour is the result. The best and worst time slot are named below it.</p>''')
